abstract—we consider a market where a set of wireless
operators compete for a large common pool of users  the
latter have a reservation utility of u  units or  equivalently 
an alternative option to satisfy their communication needs  the
operators must satisfy these minimum requirements in order to
attract the users  we model the users decisions and interaction as
an evolutionary game and the competition among the operators
as a non cooperative price game which is proved to be a potential
game  for each set of prices selected by the operators  the
evolutionary game attains a different stationary point  we show
that the outcome of both games depends on the reservation
utility of the users and the amount of spectrum w the operators
have at their disposal  we express the market welfare and the
revenue of the operators as functions of these two parameters 
accordingly  we consider the scenario where a regulating agency
is able to intervene and change the outcome of the market by
tuning w and or u   different regulators may have different
objectives and criteria according to which they intervene  we
analyze the various possible regulation methods and discuss their
requirements  implications and impact on the market 

i  introduction

consider a city where   commercial operators  companies 
and one municipal operator offer wifi internet access to
the citizens  users   the companies charge for their services
and offer better rates than the municipal wifi service which
however is given gratis  users with high needs will select
one of the companies  however  if they are charged with
high prices  or served with low rates  a portion of them will
eventually migrate to the municipal network  in other words 
the municipal service constitutes an alternative choice for the
users and therefore sets the minimum requirements which the
commercial providers should satisfy  apparently  the existence
of the municipal network affects both the user decisions and
the operators pricing policy  in different settings  the minimum
requirement can be an inherent characteristic of the users as
for example a lower bound on transmission rate for a particular
application  an upper bound on the price they are willing to pay
or certain combinations of both of these parameters  again  the
operators can attract the users only if they offer more appealing
services and prices 

in this paper  we consider a general wireless communication
services market where a set of operators  compete to sell
their services to a common large pool of users  we assume
that users have minimum requirements or alternative options
to satisfy their needs which we model by introducing the
reservation utility u        users select an operator only if the

fig     the market consists of a set of operators competing over a common
pool of users  each user selects one of the market operators or opts to abstain
from the market and be associated with the neutral operator  the latter models
the alternative out of the market users option or their minimum service price
requirements 

offered service and the charged price ensure utility higher than
u   we analyze the users strategy for selecting operator and the
price competition among the operators under this constraint 
we ﬁnd that the market outcome depends on u  and on the
amount of spectrum each operator has at his disposal w  
accordingly  we consider the existence of a regulating agency
who is interested in affecting the market and enforcing a more
desirable outcome  by tuning either w or u   for example 
consider the municipal wifi provider who is actually able
to set u  and bias the competition among the commercial
providers  this is of crucial importance since in many cases the
competition of operators may yield inefﬁcient allocation of the
network resources      or even reduced revenue for them      
we introduce a rigorous framework that allows us to analyze
the various methods through which the regulator can intervene
and affect the market outcome according to his objective 

our model captures many different settings such as a wifi
market in a city  a mobile cell phone market in a country
or even a secondary spectrum market where primary users
lease their spectrum to secondary users  in order to make our
study more realistic  we adopt a macroscopic perspective and
analyze the interaction of the operators and users in a large
time scale  for large population of users  and under limited
information  the operators are not aware of the users speciﬁc

systems  in many cases  the competition results in undesirable
outcome  for example  in     the authors consider an oligopoly
communication market and show that
it yields inefﬁcient
resource allocation for the users  from a different perspective
it is explained in      that selﬁsh pricing strategies may also
decrease the revenue of the sellers providers  in these cases 
the strategy of each node  buyer  affects the performance of
the other nodes by increasing the delay of the services they
receive       effective cost  or  equivalently  decreasing the
resource the provider allocates to them       delivered price  
this equal resource sharing assumption represents many dif 
ferent access schemes and protocols  tdma  csma ca  etc  
    

more recently 

the competition of operators in wireless
services markets has been studied in                             
the users can be charged either with a usage based pricing
scheme        or on a per subscription basis              we
adopt the latter approach since it is more representative of
the current wireless communication systems  we assume that
users may migrate  churn  from one operator to the other 
      and we use evolutionary game theory  evgt  to model
this process       this allows us to capture many realistic
aspects and to analyze the interaction of very large population
of users under limited information  the motivation for using
evgt in such systems is very nicely discussed in       due
to the existence of the neutral operator  the user strategy
is updated through a hybrid scheme based on imitation and
direct selection of p   we deﬁne a new revision protocol
to capture this aspect and we derive the respective system
dynamic equations 

although the regulation has been discussed in context of
networks       it remains largely unexplored  some recent work
          study how a regulator or an intervention device may
affect a non cooperative game among a set of players  e g 
operators   however  these works do not consider hierarchical
systems  with large populations and limited information  our
contribution can be summarized as follows:  i  we model the
wireless service market using an evolutionary game where
the users employ a new hybrid revision protocol  based both
on imitation and direct selection of a speciﬁc choice  namely
the p   we derive the differential equations that describe the
evolution of this system and ﬁnd the stationary points   ii 
we deﬁne the price competition game for i operators and
the particular case that users have minimum requirements  or
equivalently  alternative choices offers   iii  we prove that this
is a potential game and we analytically ﬁnd the nash equilib 
ria   iv  we introduce the concept of the neutral operator who
represents the system state regulator or the minimum users
requirement  and  v  we discuss different regulation methods
and analyze their efﬁcacy  implications and the resources that
are required for their implementation 

the rest of this paper is organized as follows  in section ii
we introduce the system model and in section iii we analyze
the dynamics of the users interaction and ﬁnd the stationary
point of the market  in section iv we deﬁne and solve the
price competition game among the operators and in section v

fig     the oligopoly market consists of i operators and n users  s   each
user is associated with one operator at each speciﬁc time slot  every operator
i =               i can serve more than one users at a certain time slot  the users
that fail to satisfy their minimum requirements  ui ≤ u   ∀i ∈ i  abstain
from the market and select the neutral operator p  

needs and the latter cannot predict in advance the exact level
of service they will receive  each operator has a total resource
at his disposal  e g  the aggregate service rate  which is on
average equally allocated to his subscribers            this is
due to the various network management and load balancing
techniques that the operators employ  or because of the speciﬁc
protocol that is used       each user selects the operator that
will provide the optimal combination of service quality and
price  apparently  the decision of each user affects the utility
of the other users  we model this interdependency as an
evolutionary game      the stationary point of which represents
the users distribution among the operators and depends on
the charged prices  this gives rise to a non cooperative price
competition game among the operators who strive to maximize
their proﬁts 

central to our analysis is the concept or the neutral operator
p  which provides to the users a constant and given utility of
u  units  the p  can be a special kind of operator  like the
municipal wifi provider in the example above  or it can simply
model the user choice to abstain from the market  this way 
we can directly calculate how many users are served by the
market and how many abstain from it and select p   moreover 
p  allows us to introduce the role of a regulating agency who
can intervene and bias the market outcome through the service
u   we show that p  can be used to increase the revenue of the
operators or the efﬁciency of the market  in some cases  both of
these metrics can be simultaneously improved at a cost which
is incurred by the regulator  alternatively  the outcome of the
market can be regulated by changing the amount of spectrum
each operator has at his disposal  different regulating methods
give different results and entail different cost for the regulator 

a  related work and contribution

the competition of sellers for attracting buyers has been
studied extensively in the context of network economics      
     both for the internet and more recently for wireless

we discuss the relation between the revenue of the operators
and the efﬁciency of the market and their dependency on the
system parameters  accordingly  we analyze various regulation
methods for different regulation objectives and give related
numerical examples  we conclude in section vi 

ii  system model

we consider a wireless service market  hereafter referred to
as a market  with a very large set of users n =                n  
and a set of operators i =                i   which is depicted
in figure    we assume a time slotted operation  each user
cannot be served by more than one operator simultaneously 
however  users can switch in each slot t between operators or
even they can opt to refrain and not purchase services from
anyone of the i operators  the net utility perceived by each
user who is served by operator i in time slot t is:

ui wi  ni t   λi  = vi wi  ni t   − λi

   

where ni t  are the users served by this speciﬁc operator in
slot t  wi the total spectrum at his disposal  and λi the charged
price  in order to describe the market operation we introduce
the users vector x t  =  x  t   x  t           xi  t   x  t    where
the ith component xi t  = ni t  n represents the portion of
users that have selected operator i ∈ i  additionally  with
x  t  = n  t  n we denote the portion of users that have
selected neither of the i operators  we assume that the number
of users n is very large  n >>   and therefore the variable
xi t  = ni t  n is considered continuous  in other words 
we assume that there exist a continuum of users partitioned
among the different operators 

   valuation function: the function vi ·  represents the
value of the offered service for each user associated with
operator i ∈ i  users are considered homogeneous: all the
users served by a certain operator are charged the same price
and perceive the same utility  we consider the following
particular valuation function:

vi wi  xi t   = log

wi

n xi t 

  xi t  >  

   

since n is given  we use xi t  instead of ni t   this function
has the following desirable properties:  i  the valuation for
each user decreases with the total number of served users by
the speciﬁc operator due to congestion   ii  increases with the
amount of available spectrum wi  and  iii  it is a concave
function and therefore captures the saturation of the user
satisfaction as the allocated resource increases  i e  it satisﬁes
the principle of diminishing marginal returns      

a basic assumption in our model is that users served by
the same operator are allocated an equal amount of resource 
we want to stress that this assumption captures many different
settings in wireline       or wireless networks                 
            some examples where the equal resource sharing
assumption holds are the following:

• fdma   tdma: if the operator uses a multiple ac 
cess scheme like frequency division multiple access
 fdma  or time division multiple access  tdma  

then the equal resource sharing assumption holds by
default       the users served by a certain operator receive
an equal share of his total available spectrum or an equal
time share of the operator’s channel 

• csma ca: a similar result holds for the carrier sense
multiple access scheme with collision avoidance       
that is used in ieee        protocols  users trying to
access the channel receive an equal share of it and achieve
  on average   the same transmission rate  additionally 
as it was shown in       even if the radio transmitters
are controlled by selﬁsh users  they can achieve this fair
resource sharing 

• random access of multiple channels: even in more
complicated access schemes as in the case  for example 
where many different users iteratively select the least
congested channel among a set of available channels  it
is proved that each user receives asymptotically an equal
share of the channel bandwidth       

additionally  the macroscopic perspective and the large time
scale that we consider in this problem   ensure that spatiotem 
poral variations in the quality of the offered services will be
smoothed out due to load balancing and other similar network
management techniques that the operators employ  therefore 
users of each operator are treated in equal terms 

   neutral operator: variable x  t  represents the portion
of users that do not select anyone of the i operators  namely 
a user in each time slot t is willing to pay operator i ∈ i
only if the offered utility ui wi  xi t   λi  is greater than a
threshold u  ≥    if all operators fail to satisfy this minimum
requirement then the user abstains from the market and is
associated with the neutral operator p   figure    in other
words  p  represents the choice of selecting neither of the
i operators and receiving utility of u  units  technically  as
it will be shown in the sequel  the inclusion of p  affects
both the user decision process for selecting operator and the
competition among the operators 

from a modeling perspective  the neutral operator may be
used to represent different realistic aspects of the wireless
service market  first  p  can be an actual operator owned by
the state  as the public municipal wifi provider we considered
in the introductory example  in this case  through the gratis u 
service  the state intervenes and regulates the market as we
will explain in section v  additionally  u  can be indirectly
imposed by the state  the regulator  through certain rules such
as the minimum amount of spectrum rate per user  finally  it
can represent the users reluctancy to pay very high prices for
poor qos  similarly to the individual rationality constraint in
mechanism design  we take these realistic aspects into account
and moreover  by using x  t   we ﬁnd precisely how many
users are not satisﬁed by the market of the i operators 

unlike the valuation vi ·  of the service offered by each
operator i ∈ i  u  is considered constant  when u  represents
users minimum requirements or respective restrictions im 
posed by regulatory rules  this assumption follows directly and
actually is imperative  in case u  models the service offered
by the neutral operator  e g  the municipal wifi network  

the constant value of u  means that it is independent of the
number of users and hence non congestible  we follow this
assumption for the following two reasons: i  u  is a free of
charge service which in general is low and hence can be
ensured for a large number of users   ii  the state agency
 i e  the regulator  who provides u   is able to increase his
resource in order to ensure a constant value for u   as we
will explain in next sections  this latter aspect captures the
cost of regulation  i e  the cost of serving users through the
neutral operator  finally  notice that our model can be easily
extended for the case that u  is a congestible service 

   revenue: each operator i ∈ i determines the price
λi ∈ r  that he will charge to his clients  the decisions
of the operators are realized in a different time scale than the
decisions of the users  namely  each operator i determines his
price in the beginning of each time epoch t which consists of
t slots  while users update their operator association decision
in each slot  let us deﬁne the price vector λ =  λi
: i =
              i  and the vector of the i −  prices of operators other
than i as λ−i =  λj : j ∈ i \ i   we assume that t is large
enough so that for each price vector λ set at the beginning of
an epoch  the market of the users reaches a stationary point  
if such a point is attainable   during this epoch  the objective
of each operator i ∈ i is to maximize his revenue during each
epoch t :

ri xi t   λi  = λixi t n

   

in these markets there are no service level agreements  slas 
or any other type of qos guarantees and hence the operators
are willing to admit and serve as many users as it is required
to achieve their goal 

iii  user strategy and market dynamics

a  evolutionary game gu among users

in order to select the optimal operator that maximizes eq 
     each user must be aware of all system parameters  i e 
the spectrum wi  the number of served users ni and the
charged price λi for each i ∈ i  however  in realistic settings
this information will not be available in advance  given these
restrictions and the large number of users  we model their
interaction and the operator selection process by deﬁning an
evolutionary game  gu   as follows:

• players: the set of the n users  n =                n   
• strategies: each user selects a certain operator i ∈ i or

the neutral operator p  

• population state:

operators

i
 x  t   x  t           xi  t   x  t   

and the

the users distribution over

the
neutral operator  x t  =

• payoff: the user’s net utility ui wi  xi t   λi  when he

selects operator i ∈ i  or u  when he selects p  

to facilitate our analysis we make the following assump 

tions:

• assumption  : the number of users n is very large 
n >>   and therefore the variable xi t  = ni t  n is
considered continuous 

• assumption  : the initial distribution of users over the
i operators is non zero: xi    >    ∀i ∈ i  it directly
follows that x     <   

in the sequel we explain how each user selects his strategy
under this limited information and what is the outcome of this
game 

b  user strategy update

a basic component of every evolutionary game is the revi 
sion protocol       it captures the dynamics of the interaction
among the users and describes in detail the process according
to which a player iteratively updates his strategy  there exist
many different options for the revision protocol  depending
on the modeling assumptions of the speciﬁc problem  these
assumptions are mainly related to how sophisticated  informed
and rational are the players  on the one extreme  fully rational
and informed players update their choices according to a best
response strategy like in the typical  non evolutionary  strate 
gic games  this means that players make a direct selection
of the best available strategy  on the other extreme  players
follow an imitation strategy  in this case a player  a  selects
randomly another player  b  and if the utility of the latter
is higher   a  imitates his strategy with a probability that
is proportional to the anticipated utility improvement  this
modeling option is suitable for imperfectly informed players 
or players with bounded rationality who update their strategy
based on a better  instead of best  response strategy  between
these two extremes  there are many different options  for
example  a player may update his strategy with a hybrid
protocol based partially on imitation and on direct selection 
    

in this work  we assume that each user updates his strategy
by a special type of hybrid revision protocol which is a com 
bination of imitation of other users associated with operators
from the set i  market operators  and direct selection of the
neutral operator p   the imitation component captures the lack
of information users have at their disposal about the market 
on the other hand  each user is aware of the exact value of
u  and hence this choice is always available through direct
selection  notice that the considered revision protocol is not
a typical hybrid protocol since the direct selection is related
only to the selection of p  and not to the other operators 

in detail  the proposed revision protocol can be described
by the following actions that each user may take in each slot
t:

   a user associated with an operator i ∈ i  selects ran 
domly another user who is associated with an operator
j ∈ i  j  = i  and if uj > ui imitates his strategy
with a probability that is proportional to the difference
 uj − ui  

   a user associated with the neutral operator p   selects
randomly another user associated with operator j ∈ i
and if uj > u   imitates his strategy with a probability
that is proportional to the difference  uj − u   

   a user associated with operator i ∈ i selects the neutral
operator p  with probability that is proportional to the

difference  u  − ui  

options   and    stem from the replicator dynamics introduced
by taylor and jonker in      and are based on imitation of
users with better strategies  on the other hand  option   is
based on direct selection of better strategies  known also as
pairwise dynamics  introduced by smith in      

after deﬁning the revision protocol  we can calculate the
rate at which users switch from one strategy  operator  to
another strategy  operator   in particular  the switch rate of
users migrating from operator i to operator j ∈ i \ i in time
slot t  is:

ρij  t  = xj t  uj  t  − ui t   

   

where xj t  is the portion of users already associated with
operator j  for simplicity  we express the user utilities as a
function with a single argument  the time t  additionally  the
users switch rate from operator i to neutral operator p   is:

ρi  t  = γ u  − ui t   

   

notice the difference between imitation and direct selection
     instead of multiplying the utilities difference with the
population x  t   we use a constant multiplier γ ∈ r  this
is due to the model assumption that switching to the neutral
operator is not accomplished through imitation and hence does
not depend on the portion of users already been associated with
p   the probabilistic aspect captures the bounded rationality 
the inertia of the users and other similar realistic aspects of
these markets  finally  the switch rate of users leaving p  and
returning to the market  option    is:

ρ i t  = xi t  ui t  − u   

   

variables ρij  ρi  and ρ i represent the rates at which
users migrate from one operator to another  including the
neutral operator p   it is interesting to notice that if these
rates are normalized properly  they can be interpreted as the
probabilities with which users update their operator selection
strategy  this approach is discussed in      in the sequel we
use these rates to derive the ordinary differential equations
 ode  that describe the evolution of the population of users 

c  market stationary points

the new type of hybrid revision protocol introduced above 
results in user market dynamics that cannot be expressed with
the known differential equations of replicator dynamics or
other similar scheme       in section a of the appendix we
prove that the mean dynamics of the system are:

dxi t 

dt

= xi t  ui t  − uavg t  − x  t  ui t  − u  

   

− γ u  − ui t      x  t  ui t  − u      ∀i ∈ i

where uavg t  =pi∈i xi t ui t  is the average utility of the

market in each slot t  the user population associated with p 
is:

dx  t 

dt

= x  xi∈i  

xi u  − ui    γ xj∈i−

xj u  − uj 

   

where i   is the subset of operators offering utility ui t  > u  
and i − is the subset of operators offering utility ui t  < u  
at slot t 

the important thing is that despite its different evolution 
as we prove in section b  this system has the same stationary
points as the systems that are described by the classical
replicator dynamic equations:

˙xi t  =   ⇒ xi t  ui t  − uavg t   =    ∀i ∈ i

   

and

˙x  t  =   ⇒ x  t  u  − uavg t   =  

    

the user state vector x∗ and the respective user utility u ∗
i   i ∈
i  that satisfy these stationary conditions can be summarized
in the following   cases:

• case a: x∗
• case b: x∗

i   x∗
i   x∗

  >   and u ∗
j >    x∗
j > u   ∀ i  j ∈ i 
j >    x∗

i   x∗

u ∗

i   u ∗

• case c: x∗

∀ i  j ∈ i 

i = u   i ∈ i 
  =   and u ∗

i = u ∗

j   with

  =   and u ∗

i = u ∗

j = u  

case a corresponds to the scenario where all operators offer
to their clients net utility which is equal to the value of the
service offered by the neutral operator  on the other hand 
in case b the market operators offer higher utility than the
neutral operator and hence all users are served by the market 
finally  in case c  the i operators offer marginal services  i e 
equal to u   but they have attracted all the users 

it

is interesting to compare the above results with the
wardrop model and the wardrop equilibrium        the market
stationary points for case a and case c satisfy the wardrop
ﬁrst principle and yield an equilibrium where the available
strategy options  ”operators” in our problem  result in equal
utility for the players  ”users”   however  this does not hold
for case b where operators other than p  offer higher utility 
this emerges due to the fact that the alternative option  or
reservation utility  is non congestible  i e  independent of x  
the evolutionary game allows us to provide a richer model
than the typical wardrop model and more importantly to
capture the users interaction and dynamics 

before calculating the stationary point x∗ for each case 
and in order to facilitate our analysis  we deﬁne the scalar
parameter αi = wi  n eu   for each operator i ∈ i and
the respective vector α =  αi
: i =               i   as it will
be explained in the sequel  these parameters determine the
operators and users interaction and will help us to explain the
role of the regulator  we can ﬁnd the stationary points for case
a by using equation ui wi  x∗
i   λi  = u  and imposing the
constraint x∗
  >    apparently  the state vector x∗ depends on
the price vector λ  therefore  we deﬁne the set of all possible
case a stationary points  xa  as follows  see section b for

   stability of stationary points: now that we found the
stationary points of the hybrid revision protocol  it is important
to characterize their stability  we prove in the sequel that these
points are evolutionary stable strategies  ess  and hence they
are locally asymptotically stable  i e  stable within a limited
region  ess and replicator dynamics are the two concepts used
for studying evolutionary games  unlike the replicator dynam 
ics  ess is a static concept which requires that the strategy
of players in the equilibrium is stable when it is invaded by a
small population of players playing a different strategy       
when the players population is homogeneous  as we assumed

not every stable steady state is an ess  additionally  every
ess is nash  and hence ess is a reﬁnement of the nash
equilibrium 

let us ﬁrst give a simple deﬁnition of the ess  tailored to
our system model  assume that the users market has reached
the stationary state described by vector x∗  suppose now that a
small portion ǫ >   of the users population deviates from their
decision in the stationary state  i e  selects another operator 
and selects another operator j ∈ i or the neutral operator 
this yields a new distribution of users which we denote by
    we say that x∗ is an ess if  i  users
xǫ =  xǫ
that deviate from x∗ receive lower utility in the new system
state xǫ or   ii  the utility of the deviating users in xǫ is the
same as in the previous state x∗  but the utility of the legitimate
users  those insisting in their initial decisions  is higher in xǫ
than in x∗  in both cases  the deviating users worsen their
obtained utility  the stationary points derived above satisfy
these conditions and hence they are ess

the decision of
i   λi  > uj wj  xǫ

in detail  assume that the system has a stationary point
  =    suppose that a
x∗ =  x∗
user who is associated with operator i ∈ i deviates and selects
another operator j ∈ i  in this case  the population of users in
operator i decreases  xǫ
i and the population of users in
j   initially  these two operators
operator j increases  xǫ
offered identical utility  ui wi  x∗
j   λj  
the deviating user
but after
it becomes
j   λj   clearly  the deviating user
ui wi  xǫ
obtains less utility and hence there is no incentive to deviate 
similarly  if a user deviates and selects the neutral operator 
he will receive reduced utility since when x∗ ∈ xb  it is
u ∗

i > u   ∀i ∈ i 
assume now that the system attains a stationary point x∗ ∈
xa  similarly to the previous analysis  it is straightforward
that a user who deviates from x∗ and moves from an operator
i ∈ i to another operator j ∈ i will decrease his utility  if
the user migrates to the neutral operator  his utility will not be
reduced because u  is constant  non congestible   however 
in this case  the users that will insist in their initial choice of
operator i will now receive higher utility due to the move of the
deviator  due to the ess deﬁnition and speciﬁcally according
to smith’s second condition        this is not a preferable
choice for the deviator and hence x∗ ∈ xb is an ess 

finally  when x∗ ∈ xc  user deviation from a market
operator i ∈ i to another market operator j ∈ i or to p 
is not beneﬁcial for the deviator  either because it decreases
his utility or because it increases the utility of other users 
in conclusion  the stationary points of the proposed revision
protocol are ess equilibriums and hence locally stable 

iv  price competition among operators

in the previous section we analyzed the stationary points
of users interaction and showed that
they depend on the
prices selected by the operators  each operator anticipates the
users strategy and chooses accordingly for each epoch t the
price that maximizes his revenue  this gives rise to a non 
cooperative price competition game gp among the operators

b  best response strategy of operators

the best response of each operator i  λ∗

i   to the prices
selected by the other i −  operators  λ−i  depends on the users
market stationary point  notice that for certain λ−i  operator
i may be able to select a price such that  λi  λ−i  belongs to
any price set  Λa  Λb or Λc  while for some λ−i the operator
choice will be restricted in two or even a single price set 

best response when λ ∈ Λa: if the i−  operators j ∈ i\i
select such prices  λ−i  that the market stationary point is

x∗ ∈ xa  then operator i ﬁnds the price λ∗

the objective function of this problem is quasi concave 
      however  the constraint deﬁnes an open set and hence
uniqueness of optimal solution is not ensured  to overcome
this obstacle we substitute constraint eq       with the closed
set:

λi ≥ log

  ǫ

    

where ǫ >   is an arbitrary small constant number  this
inequality stems from eq       by solving for λi and adding
ǫ  it does not affect the problem deﬁnition and formulation
nor the obtained results since  as we will prove in the sequel 
operators do not select a price in the lower bound of the
constraint set  after this transformation the problem has a
unique optimal solution which is equal to the solution of the
respective unconstrained problem  λ∗

that is played in the beginning of each time epoch t   we
assume that operators are aware of the parameters of the users
market and also know the values of parameters αi  i ∈ i
and u   speciﬁcally  we model the operators competition as
a static simultaneous move normal form game of complete
information  following the bertrand competition model     
we are interested not only in ﬁnding the nash equilibriums
 ne  of this game but also to understand if and how the game
converges to them 

we prove that gp is a potential game and hence if it
is played in many rounds and operators choose their prices
based on the previous prices of the other operators  the game
converges to a ne  in other words  we analyze the dynamics
induced by the repeated play of the same game assuming
that operators follow simple myopic rules  we show that
the equilibrium of the competition game depends on vector
α and the value of u   for certain combinations of these
parameters  the game admits a unique equilibrium while for
other combinations  it reaches one of the inﬁnitely many
equilibriums depending on the initial prices 

a  price competition game gp

before analyzing this game  it is important to emphasize
that the revenue function depends on the price vector λ  in
particular  using equation      we can calculate the revenue of
operator i when λ ∈ Λa  when λ ∈ Λb  and when λ ∈ Λc 
denoted as ra

i  ·  respectively:

i  ·  and rc

i  ·   rb
ra

i  λi  = rc

i  λi  = αiλin e−λi

and

rb

i  λi  λ−i  =

i=  αie−λi

eλipi

i  ·  and rc

i  ·  depend only on the price selected by operator
ra
i  while rb
i  ·  depends on the entire price vector λ  however 
in all cases  the price set  Λa  Λb or Λc  to which the price
vector λ =  λi  λ−i  belongs  is determined jointly by all the
i operators 

let us now deﬁne the non cooperative pricing game

among the i operators  gp =  i   λi    ri  :

• the set of players is the set of the i operators i =

s t 

               i  

• the strategy space of each player i is its price λi ∈
    λmax   λmax ∈ r   and the strategy proﬁle is the
price vector λ =  λ   λ           λi   of the operators 

• the payoff function of each player is his revenue ri :

 λi  λ−i  → r  where ri = ra

i or rb

i  
i or rc

the particular characteristic of this game is that each operator
has   different payoff functions depending on the price proﬁle 
despite this characteristic  the payoff function is continuous
and quasi concave as we prove in the appendix  section c 
in the sequel  we analyze the best response of each operator
which constitutes a reaction curve to the prices set by the other
operators  the equilibrium of the game gp is the intersection
of the reaction curves of the operators 

this is also a concave problem which would have a unique
solution if the constraint set was closed and compact  again 
we substitute the constraint with the  almost  equivalent in 
equality:

λi ≤ log

− ǫ

    

now  the problem has a unique solution which coincides with
the solution of the respective unconstrained problem  denoted
i   if  µ∗

of each operator i is directly determined by the prices that the

we can summarize the best response price strategy of each

operator i ∈ i  by deﬁning his revenue function as follows:

for each possible price vector λ−i of the i \ i operators 
operator i will solve all the above optimization problems and
ﬁnd the solution that yields the highest revenue  in section

i and pb
transformation of the constraint set of problems pa

did not affect the best response strategy of operator i since
he only selects the solution of the respective unconstrained
problems 

c  equilibrium analysis of gp

the price competition game gp is a ﬁnite ordinal potential
game and therefore not only has pure nash equilibria but
also the players can reach them under any best response
strategy  that is  if we consider that gp is played repeatedly
by the operators who update their strategy with a myopic best
response method  we can show that the convergence to the
equilibriums is ensured under any ﬁnite improvement path
 fip         the potential function is:

j=  log λj − λj  

p λ  = pi
ifpi
pi
j=  log λj − λj  − log  pi

j=  αje−λj ≤   

j=  αje−λj    else 

the detailed proof is given in section e  in order to ﬁnd the
ne we solve the system of equations       i =               i and

the outcome of the game gu affects the strategy of opera 
tors and therefore the outcome of the game gp  a price vector
−i  is an equilibrium of the game gp   parameterized by
 λ∗
the vector α =  α   α           αi    if it satisﬁes:

i   λ∗

ri λ∗

i   λ∗

−i  α  ≥ ri λi  λ∗

−i  α   ∀ i ∈ i  ∀λi ≥    ∀ x∗

in order to simplify our study and focus on the results and
implications of our analysis  we assume that all operators have
the same amount of available spectrum wi = w and therefore
it is also αi = α  ∀i ∈ i 

the equilibrium of the price competition game and subse 
quently the market stationary point x∗  depend on the value
of α  these results are summarized in table ii and stem from
the following theorem:

theorem iv    the non cooperative game gp where opera 
tors select their strategy in order to maximize their revenue 
converges to one of the following pure nash equilibria:

i

• if α ∈ a  =     e i   there is a unique nash equilibrium
i =   : i =               i  and the

λ∗ ∈ Λa  with λ∗ =  λ∗
respective unique market stationary point is x∗ ∈ xa 

• if α ∈ a  =  e

i−   i  ∞   there is a unique nash
equilibrium λ∗ ∈ Λb  with λ∗ =  λ∗
i−  : i =
              i   which induces a unique respective market
stationary point x∗ ∈ xb 

i = i

• if α ∈ a  =  e i  e

i−   i   there exist inﬁnitely many
equilibria  λ∗ ∈ Λc  and each one of them yields a
respective market stationary point x∗ ∈ xc 

i

proof: in section e of the appendix we provide the
detailed proof according to which gp is a potential game and
in section f we use iterated strict dominance to ﬁnd the nash
equilibrium λ∗ which depends on parameter α 

in conclusion  gp is a non cooperative game of complete
information that attains certain pure nash equilibriums  ne 
which depend on parameters αi  i =               i  it is proved to
be a potential game and hence the equilibriums can be reached
if gp is played repeatedly and operators update their strategy
by simple best response or other similar utility improvement
methods  if αi parameters are equal  i e  αi = α  ∀i ∈ i  then
the ne is unique for α ∈ a  or α ∈ a   for the case α ∈ a  
the reached equilibrium depends on the initial price vector 

v  market outcome and regulation

operator j   is improved:

the outcome of the users and operators interaction can
be characterized by the following two fundamental criteria:
the efﬁciency of the users market and the total revenue the
operators accrue  we show that both of them depend on
parameter α and we further explore the impact of w and
u  on them  accordingly  we analyze the problem from a
mechanism design perspective and explain how a regulator  as
the municipal wifi provider in the introductory example  can
bias the market operation  outcome  by adjusting the value of
α  we consider different regulation methods and discuss their
implications 

a  market outcome and regulation criteria

   market efﬁciency: a market is efﬁcient if the users
enjoy high utilities in the stationary point  however  in certain
scenarios  the services provided by the p  may impose an
additional cost to the system  e g  the cost of the municipal
wifi provider is borne by the citizens  and hence it would
be preferable to have all the users served by the i operators 
therefore  we use the following two metrics to characterize
the efﬁciency of the market:  i  the aggregate utility  uagg  of
users in the stationary point x∗  and  ii  the cost j  = x n u 
incurred by the neutral operator p  for serving the portion x 
of the users  both of these metrics depend on parameter α and
hence on system parameters w and u  

in detail:
• when α ∈ a  =     e i   it is x∗ ∈ xa  which means
  > selects p   the latter incurs
 n u  units  all users receive utility of u 

that a portion of users x∗
cost of j  = x∗
units and hence the aggregate utility is uagg = n u  

• on the other hand  when α ∈ a  =  e i  ei  i−   i  
it is x∗ ∈ xc  in this case  all users are served by the
i = u  for i =
i operators with marginal utility  i e  u ∗
              i  there is no cost for p   i e  j  =    again 
it is uagg = n u  but unlike the previous case  there is
no cost for p  

• finally  if α ∈ a  =  ei  i−   i  ∞  it is x∗ ∈ xb  all
  =   and j  =
i > u   i =               i 

users are served by the i operators  i e  x∗
   and receive high utilities u ∗
the welfare is higher in this case  i e  uagg > n u  

in summary  the aggregate utility of the users changes with α
as follows:

uagg = n u  

n  log  w i

n   − i

i−    

if α ∈ a  ∪ a  
if α ∈ a  

    

it can be easily veriﬁed that uagg is a continuous function 

we have expressed uagg in terms of w and u  in order to
investigate the impact of the system parameters in the market 
when α ∈ a ∪a   uagg increases with u  and is independent
of the spectrum w   on the contrary  when α ∈ a   uagg
increases with w and is independent of u   notice that when
the value of α changes from a  to interval a   uagg remains
the same but the other metric of efﬁciency  the cost of neutral

j  =  αin u

is proportional to α  increases with the available spectrum w  
decreases with u  and is independent of the number n of
users  in figure   we depict the revenue of each operator for
different values of α  in a duopoly market  notice that the
revenue increases linearly with α ∈     e    

when α ∈ a   the competition of the operators may attain
different equilibria  λ∗ ∈ Λc  depending on the initial prices
and on the sequence the operators update their prices  in figure
  we present the revenue of two operators  duopoly  at the
equilibrium  for various initial prices and for α = e ∈ a  
here we assume that the  st operator is able to set his price
λ     before the  nd operator  also  in figure   we illustrate
the dependence of the revenue of the operators on the value
of α when it lies in a   given that λ     =      for certain
prices  e g  when λ     = log  α  both operators accrue the
same revenue at the equilibrium  r∗

  = n log  α

  = r∗

 

 

if α ∈ a  =  ei  i−    ∞  all operators set their prices to
i = i  i −    and get r∗
i = n  i −    units  as shown
λ∗
in table ii  figure   depicts the competition of two operators
and the convergence to the respective nash equilibria for α =
e  ∈ a   we assume that both operators have selected prices
λ     = λ     = log  α ≈      however  this price vector
does not constitute a ne and hence an operator  e g  the  st 
can temporarily increase his revenue by decreasing his price
to λ  =    accordingly  the other operator   nd  will react
by reducing his price to λ  =      gradually  the competition
of the operators will converge to the ne where both of them
  =      −    =   and will have revenue
will set λ∗
  = λ∗
  =    interestingly  the revenue of both operators
r∗
  = r∗
in the equilibrium is lower than their initial revenue when
they did not compete  finally  notice that  unlike the aggregate
utility uagg  the revenue of the operators depends only on
α = w  n eu    and not the speciﬁc values of w and u  
before we proceed  let us summarize the above results:

• if α ∈ a  =     e i   it is r∗

i = αn e−  = w e− u     
i =               i  operators receive equal revenue which is
 i  proportional to w    ii  inversely proportional to u 
and  iii  independent of the number of users n

• if α ∈ a  =  e i  ei  i−

the outcome of the operator competition  gp equilibrium  for

all the users receive utility equal to u   the regulator can
improve the market efﬁciency  i e  increase uagg and decrease
j   by increasing the value of α  this can be achieved either
by increasing w or decreasing u   let us assume that the
regulator selects the ﬁrst method  for example  he can change
the price of w and allow the operators to acquire more
spectrum  if w is increased until α = e i  then the market
stationary point x∗ switches to xb  in this case  all users
  =    but they still receive only
are served by the market  x∗
marginal utility  uagg = n u   if the regulator provides even
more spectrum w to operators so as α > ei  i−   i  then
  =   and moreover the users perceive higher utility because
x∗
uagg increases proportional to log w   eq        obviously  the
improvement in market efﬁciency comes at the cost  opportu 
nity cost  of the additional spectrum the regulator must provide
to operators 

on the other hand  the regulator may prefer to directly in 
tervene in the market through p  and tune u   if u  decreases 
  decreases and users return to the market  to
the value of x∗
the i operators   the portion of users x∗
  becomes zero when
α = e i  this way  the cost of the regulator j  decreases
 since p  serves less users  but at the same time the aggregate
utility  uagg = n u   is also reduced  namely  uagg decreases
linearly with u  until α = ei  i−   i and remains constant
for larger values of u   eq        again  the decision of the
regulator depends on his cost and on the efﬁciency he wants to
achieve  in conclusion  depending on they system parameters
 n  w  i  the efﬁciency of the market may be improved either
by increasing the resources of operators  sell more spectrum 
or by rendering highly competitive the services provided by
the neutral operator p  

   regulating for revenue: as illustrated in table ii  the
revenue of the operators increases proportionally to α for
α ∈ a   and proportionally to log α for α ∈ a   while
it remains constant when α ∈ a   notice that the revenue 
unlike the market efﬁciency  depends on the value of α and

fig     the regulator selects parameter α  the operators compete and select
the respective optimal prices λ∗
i   and then  the users are divided among the
operators 

b  regulation of the wireless service market

since both the market efﬁciency and the operator revenue
depend on α and system parameters w and u   a regulating
agency can act as a mechanism designer and steer the outcome
of the market in a more desirable equilibrium according to
his objective  this can be achieved by determining directly
or indirectly  e g  through pricing  the amount of spectrum
w each operator has at his disposal  or by intervening in
the market and setting the value u  as the example with the
municipal wifi internet provider  this process is depicted in
figure   

   regulating to increase market efﬁciency: first  we
highlight the impact of parameters w and u  on the efﬁciency
metrics  this is of crucial importance because tuning w or u 
has different implications for the regulator and the market  for
example  as it is explained below  the regulator can achieve
the same level of market efﬁciency either by selling more
spectrum to operators  e g  by decreasing the spectrum price 
or by allocating more spectrum to the neutral operator:

• assume that u  is ﬁxed  as the allocated spectrum w to
each operator increases  aggregate utility uagg remains
constant until parameter α increases up to α ≥ ei  i−  
 
when α ∈ a   uagg is log proportional to w   also 
the cost j  increases with w   as long as α ∈ a   and
becomes zero for larger values of α 

i

• assume that w is ﬁxed  uagg increases with u  as long
as α ∈ a  ∪ a   for larger values of α  uagg does not
depend directly on u   additionally  the cost j  increases
with u  as long as α ∈ a  while for larger values of α
it becomes zero 

let us now give a speciﬁc scenario for regulation  assume
that initially α ∈ a  =     e i   hence  a portion of users
is not served by anyone of the i operators  x∗
  >   and

and n =      users  in the upper plot  it is u  =     and
the regulator increases the value of α by increasing w   the
aggregate utility is constant and equal to uagg = n u  =    
for α < e    −     ≈     while it increases proportionally
to log w for α >      obviously  increasing the spectrum of
operators improves both their revenue and the efﬁciency of the
market 

in the lower plot  the spectrum at the disposal of each
operator is constant  w =       and the regulator increases
the value of α by decreasing u   in this case 
the total
revenue increases but at the expense of market efﬁciency 
when α ∈ a  ∪ a  =     e        the aggregate utility uagg
is reduced as u  decreases but for α > e      it remains
constant  notice that for very small values of α  uagg is large 
however  this desirable result comes at a cost for the regulator 
namely  in this case only a small portion of users are served
by the market  while the rest of them select p   therefore  the
incurred cost j  for the regulator is high 

another interesting point in figure   is the following  in
the upper subplot  for u  =      the total operators revenue
is rtot =      units and the aggregate utility is uagg =     
achieved by increasing the spectrum w until w =       
units  which yields α =      in the lower plot  the same total
revenue is reached for w =       and decreasing u  until
u  =       units  in this case  the aggregate utility is uagg =
     units  if  for example  the regulator is interesting only in
maximizing the revenue of operators  then he would prefer the
ﬁrst method since it requires less spectrum and lower value
for u

game and the competition of the operators as a non cooperative
game of complete information  we proved that
the latter
is a potential game and hence has pure nash equilibriums 
the two games are realized in different time scale but they
are interrelated  additionally  both of them depend on the
reservation utility u  and the amount of spectrum w each
operator has at his disposal  accordingly  we considered a
regulating agency and discussed how he can intervene and
change the outcome of the market by tuning either u  or w  
various regulation methods yield different market outcomes
and induce a different cost for the regulator

a  derivation of evolutionary dynamics

here  we derive the new differential equations that describe
the evolution of the market of the users under the new
introduced revision protocol  recall that  the latter is described
by the following equations:

ρij t  = xj t  uj t  − ui t     ∀i  j ∈ i

ρi  t  = γ u  − ui t     ∀i ∈ i

ρ i t  = xi t  ui t  − u     ∀i ∈ i

    

    

    

where ρij t  is the rate at which users associated with operator
i switch to operator j in time slot t  ρi  t  is the switch rate
from operator i to neutral operator p  and ρ i t  the rate at
which users return from p  to an operator i ∈ i in the market 
the constant value γ ∈ r  represents the frequency of the
direct selection 

for imitation based revision protocols  the dynamics of the
system can be described with the well known replicator dy 
namics      the hybrid revision protocol deﬁned in equations
           and      is in part imitation based  ρij t  and ρ i t  
and in part a probabilistic direct selection of the neutral oper 
ator  ρi  t    therefore  the respective evolutionary dynamics
of the system cannot be described by the replicator dynamic

equations which correspond to the pure imitation mechanism 
we have to stress that the hybrid protocol that we introduce 
differs from the hybrid protocol in     in that users select
directly only the neutral operator and not the other i operators 
the portion of users xi who are associated with operator
i changes from time t to the time t   δt  according to the
following equation:

lemma a    the stationary points of the evolutionary dy 
namics deﬁned in equations            and      are identical
to the stationary points of the ordinary replicator dynamics
    given by:

˙xi t  =   ⇒ xi t  ui t  − uavg t   =    ∀ i ∈ i

and

xj t  uj t  − ui t   

˙x  t  =   ⇒ x  t  u  − uavg t   =  

    

    

xi t   δt  = xi t  − xi t δtxj = 

− xi t δtγ u  t  − ui t   

 

δtxj t xi t  ui t  − uj t   

    

i

xj= 

for δt →   we obtain the derivative:

dxi t 

dt

= xi t  xj = 

xj t ui t  −xj = 

− γ u  − ui     x  t  ui − u    

xj t uj  t 

proof: first we prove that 

in any stationary point 
j   j ∈ i − should be equal to zero  we prove this claim by
x∗
j >    since uavg ≥ u  > uj 
contradiction  assume that x∗
this implies that there should be at least one operator i with
ui > uavg and x∗
i >    therefore  ui − uavg  cannot be
equal to zero ∀i ∈ i    and ˙xi will be nonzero for at least one
operator  therefore      cannot be satisﬁed  if x∗

j  =   

when xj =    the evolutionary dynamics given by eq       

     and      reduce to ordinary replicator dynamics:

or  if we omit the time index and rewrite the equation:

dxi t 

dt

= xi ui − uavg − x  ui − u   − γ u  − ui  

  x  ui − u    

which can be analyzed in:

dxi t 

dt

= xi ui − uavg   ∀i ∈ i  

    

dxj  t 

dt

= xj  uj − uavg −  γ − x   u  − uj    ∀j ∈ i −     

where i   is the set of operators offering utility ui t  ≥ u  
and i − is the set of operators offering utility uj t  < u  

the dynamics of the population x  can be derived in a

similar way:

˙xi t  = xi t  ui t  − uavg t   ∀i ∈ i

˙x  t  = x  t  u  − uavg t  

    

stationary points are identical to the stationary points of the
typical replicator dynamics      

i =    or  ii  x∗

due to this lemma 

the stationary points for the users
population associated with each operator i ∈ i should satisfy
one of the following conditions:  i  x∗
i >  
i = uavg  similarly  for the neutral operator p   eq 
and u ∗
      it must hold:  i  x∗
  >  
and u  = uavg or  iii  x∗
  =   and u  = uavg  the case
i =   implies zero revenue for the ith operator and hence
x∗
case  i  does not constitute a valid choice  therefore  there
exist in total   possible combinations  cases  that will satisfy
the stationarity properties given by eq       and     :

  =   and u  < uavg   ii  x∗

x  t   δt  = x  t  − x  t δtxi = 

xi t δtγ u  − ui  

xi t  ui − u   

    

  xi = 

which can be written as:

dx  t 

dt

=  x  xi∈i  

xi u  − ui    γ xj∈i−

xj u  − uj       

equations            and      describe the evolutionary

dynamics of game gu  

b  analysis of stationary points

despite the different dynamics  the system reaches the same
stationary points as if users where employing the typical
imitation revision protocol  in detail  the market state vector
at a ﬁxed point  x∗ =  x∗
 : ∀ i ∈ i    ∀ j ∈ i −   can
be found by the following set of equations:

i   x∗

j   x∗

• case a: x∗
• case b: x∗

u ∗

i   u ∗

• case c: x∗

∀ i  j ∈ i 

i   x∗
i   x∗

  >   and u ∗
j >    x∗
j > u   ∀ i  j ∈ i 
j >    x∗

i   x∗

i = u   i ∈ i 
  =   and u ∗

i = u ∗

j   with

  =   and u ∗

i = u ∗

j = u  

we ﬁnd now the exact value of the market state vector at
the equilibrium  stationary point  x∗ for each case  first  we
deﬁne for every operator i ∈ i the scalar parameter αi =
wi  n eu   and the respective vector α =  αi : i ∈ i  

we can ﬁnd the stationary points for case a by using the
i   λi  = u  and imposing the constraint

equation ui wi  x∗

apparently  the state vector x∗ depends on the operators’ price
vector λ  therefore  we deﬁne the set of all possible case a
stationary points  xa  as follows:

xa = x∗

i = αie−λi   ∀i ∈ i  x∗

  =  −

αie−λi : λ ∈ Λa 

where Λa is the set of prices for which a stationary point in
xa is reachable  i e  x∗

i

xi= 

Λa =  λ   λ           λi   :

similarly  for case b  we calculate the stationary points by
j   λj  

i   λi  = uj wj  x∗

using the set of equations ui wi  x∗
∀ i  j ∈ i  which yields:

moreover since x∗

  =   for case b  the following holds:

x∗
i =

using      and      

x∗
i =

additionally  ui > u  implies that:

− λi > u  ⇒ x∗

therefore  we deﬁne the set of all possible case c stationary
points  xc  as follows:

xc = x∗

i = αie−λi   ∀ i ∈ i  x∗

  =   : λ ∈ Λc 

with

Λc =  λ   λ           λi   :

αie−λi =   

i

xi= 

first  we show that the revenue of each operator i ∈ i
is a continuous and a quasi concave function  secondly  we
analyze best response pricing in game gp  then  we derive
the nash equilibriums  nes  of the game using iterated strict
dominance  finally  we prove convergence to these equilibri 
ums by showing that gp is a potential game 

c  properties of the revenue function

the revenue function of each operator i is given by the

following equation:

if λi < l  

if λi ≥ l  

    

αiλin
j=  αje−λj

ri λi  λ−i  =

where l  = log αi    −pj =i αje−λj    

eλipi

αiλin e−λi

each component  for each case  is a positive function which
is also log concave  this means that it is a quasiconcave
function and hence uniqueness of optimal solution is ensured
for a proper constraint set  namely  it is:

fa λi  = log αiλin e−λi = log αiλin − λi

    

x∗
i <

αie−λi ⇒

αie−λi >  

    

and

xi= 

xi= 

xi= 

therefore  according to      and       we deﬁne the set of all
possible case b stationary points  xb  as follows:

xb = x∗

i =

αi
j=  αje−λj

  ∀i ∈ i  x∗

  =   : λ ∈ Λb 

where Λb is the set of prices for which a stationary point in
xb is feasible  u ∗

i > u :

eλipi

Λb =  λ   λ           λi   :

αie−λi >   

i

xi= 

finally  the stationary points for the case c solution must

satisfy the following:

ui = u  

x∗
  =  

    

which yields:

i = αie−λi 
x∗

i

xi= 

αie−λi =  

    

fa λi     =

 
λi

−   ⇒ fa λi     =

− 
λ 
i

<  

    

hence  fa ·  which is the log function of ra
i  ·   is concave
which means that the later is log concave and since it is
i  λi  >    it is also quasi concave  similarly  for the other
ra
component of the revenue function:

fb λi  λ−i  = log

αiλin

αi   βeλi

= log αiλin − log αi   βeλi
    

where β =pj =i αje−λi  the second derivative is:
 αi   βeλi   <  

fb λi  λ−i     =

αiβeλi

−

− 
λ 
i

    

hence  rb
that the function is continuous:

i  ·  is also quasiconcave  finally  it is easy to see

ra

i  l   λ−i  = rb

i  l   λ−i  = n    − β  log

αi

d  best response pricing in gp

each operator i ﬁnds his best response price λ∗

i for each
price proﬁle of the other i −   operators by solving the
following optimization problems  for the case the price vector
belongs to the set Λa  λ ∈ Λa   pa
i  :

s t 

αiλin e−λi

max
λi≥ 

αje−λj <  

i

xj= 

    

    

in order to ensure the uniqueness of the problem solution  we
transform the constraint set to a closed and compact set as
follows:

finally  for the special case that λ ∈ Λc  the price of each
operator i is directly determined by the prices that the other
operators have selected  namely:

    

λc
i = log

αi

  −pj =i αje−λj

whether each operator i will agree and adopt this price or not 
depends on the respective accrued revenue  rc

i  λc

i   λ−i  

in the sequel  we examine and analyze jointly the solutions
of the above optimization problems and derive the exact best
response of the ith operator for each vector λ−i of the i −  
prices 

lemma a    for each operator i ∈ i  if     λ−i   ∈ Λa  then
there is no best response price λ∗
i   λ−i  ∈ Λa 
that is  operator i will not select Λa 

i   such that  λ∗

proof: given that the price vector λ ∈ Λa  best response

price is:

if     λ−i   ∈ Λa 

    

where l  = λc

if     λ−i   ∈ Λa 

is the price operator i selects when λ ∈ Λc 
then l    ǫ >    otherwise price
vector  l    ǫ  λ−i  will not belong to Λa  therefore  ra
i  · 
is a decreasing function at the point λi = λ    ǫ due to
quasi concavity property  therefore  if     λ−i   ∈ Λa  then
i always
rc
i  
gives better response than λa

i  l    ǫ  which means that λc

i  l   = ra

i  l   > ra

lemma a    let us denote with µ∗

the unconstraint problem p b
 µ∗
that  λ∗

i   λ−i  ∈ Λb 

the optimal solution of
i   for each operator i ∈ i  if
i   such

i   λ−i   ∈ Λb  then there is no best response price λ∗

proof: given that the price vector λ ∈ Λb  best response

price is:

and recall that λc
i   λ−i   ∈ Λb  then l  − ǫ <
i   otherwise  the price vector  l  − ǫ  λ−i  cannot be in
µ∗
Λb  therefore  rb
i  ·  is an increasing function at the point
λi = λ  − ǫ due to quasi concavity property  therefore  if
i  l  − ǫ  which
 µ∗
means that λc

i always gives better response than λb
i  

i   λ−i   ∈ Λb  then rc

i  l   = rb

i  l   > rb

in other words  the previous two lemmas state that the only
eligible best response for each operator i ∈ i in the price sets
Λa and Λb are prices λ∗
i respectively 
theorem a    the best response price of an operator i is:

i =   and and λ∗

i = µ∗

if  µ∗

i = l   otherwise 

i   λ−i  ∈ Λb

proof: first we prove that     λ−i  ∈ Λa and  µ∗

Λb cannot be true at the same time  since µ∗

i   λ−i  ∈
i is the optimal

λi ≥ log

αi

  −pj =i αje−λj

where ǫ >   is an arbitrary small positive constant number  as
we will show immediately this transformation of the constraint
set does not affect the solution of the game  the problem now
is quasi concave with a closed and compact constraint set and
hence it has a unique optimal solution       which we denote
i and it is:
λa

λa
i =    or λa

i = log

αi

  −pj =i αj e−λj

i =   is the optimal solution of the respective
the value λa
unconstrained problem  which yields optimal revenue ra
i =
αn e  and it is feasible if λ =     λ−i  ∈ Λa  otherwise 
since ra
i  ·  is a decreasing function of λi  operator i can
i   λ−i  ∈ Λa 
only select the minimum price λa
similarly  when the price vector belongs to the set Λb  i e 
λ ∈ Λb  the revenue maximization problem for each operator

i   is:

s t 

max
λi≥ 

λiαin

eλipj∈i αje−λj

similarly to the previous analysis  we transform the constraint
set
to a closed and compact set by using the following
inequality:

λi ≤ log

− ǫ

    

αi

  −pj =i αje−λj

this is also a concave problem which has unique solution and
can be either the optimal solution of the respective uncon 
i   λ−i  ∈ Λb  or the maximum price
strained problem  λ∗
for which the price vector belongs to Λb  rb
i  ·  increases with

e  existence and convergence analysis of nash equilibriums
in the previous section  we derived the best response strat 
egy for each player of the game gp  the next important steps
are  i  to explore the existence of nash equilibriums  ne  for
gp  and  ii  to study if the convergence to them is guaranteed 
in       it is proven that if the game can be modeled as
a potential game  not only the existence of pure nes are
ensured  but also convergence to them is guaranteed under
any ﬁnite improvement path  in other words  a potential game
always converges to pure ne when the players adjust their
strategies based on accumulated observations as game unfolds 
in this section  we provide the necessary deﬁnitions for ordinal
potential games  and we prove that game gp belongs in this
class of games 
deﬁnition a    a game  i  λ   ri   is an ordinal potential
game  if there is a potential function p :     λmax  → r such
that the following condition holds:

sgn ri λi  λ−i  − ri λ′

sgn p λi  λ−i  − p λ′

i  λ−i   =
i  λ−i  ∀i ∈ i  λi  λ′

i ∈     λmax 

    

where sgn ·  is the sign function 
lemma a    the game gp is an ordinal potential game 

proof: we deﬁne the potential function as:

p λ  = pi
j=   log λj − λj   ifpi
pi
j=   log λj − λj  − log  pi

therefore

f  detailed analysis of nash equilibriums

in the previous section  we proved the existence of pure
ne and convergence to them  in this section  we extend our
analysis further in order to ﬁnd these nes  for the sake of
simplicity  we consider the case where all the operators have
same amount of available spectrum wi = w and hence αi =
α  ∀i ∈ i 

before starting our analysis  we rewrite constraint of set Λa

given in eq       as follows:

α ≤

 

pj∈i e−λj

=

h  eλj |j ∈ i  

i

    

where h ·  is the harmonic mean function of the variables
 eλ    eλ           eλi   =   eλj |j ∈ i  :

h  eλj |j ∈ i   =

i

e−λ    e−λ            e−λi

therefore  if λ ∈ Λa  it is:

h  eλj |j ∈ i   ≥ αi

similarly  according to       if λ ∈ Λb then:

h  eλj |j ∈ i   ≤ αi

and ﬁnally  if λ ∈ Λc:

h  eλj |j ∈ i   = αi

    

    

    

    

next  we deﬁne a new variable  h as the natural logarithm of
the harmonic mean:

h = log h  eλj |j ∈ i  

    

note that  since eh is the harmonic mean of  eλj |j ∈ i   we
can say that one of the following should hold:

   every operator i ∈ i adopts the same price λi = h 
   if one operator j ∈ i selects a price λj < h  then there
must be at least one other operator k ∈ i who will adopt
a price λk > h 

additionally  we deﬁne the variable h−i which is similar to h
except that price of the ith operator is excluded  that is:

h−i = log h  eλj |j ∈ i \ i   

    

it is obvious that if λi > h  then h−i < h  if λi < h  then
h−i > h  and if λi = h  then h−i = h 

lemma a    if α ∈ a  =     e i   there is a unique ne
λ∗ ∈ Λa  with λ∗ =  λ∗

i =   : i ∈ i 

proof: first  we prove that the ne cannot be in Λb or
Λc  λ∗  ∈ Λb ∪ Λc  if α ∈ a  =     e i   notice that  when
the price vector is not in Λa  h ≤ log αi  <   for given α
values  therefore there exists at least one operator with price
less than one  since rb
is an increasing function between
i
λi ∈         operators with λi <   would gain more revenue
by unilaterally increasing their prices  therefore λ∗ can only
be in Λa  according to theorem a    given that the price
vector is in Λa  optimal price for any operator i can only be
i =   if     λ−i  ∈ Λa  since λ∗ =  λ∗
λa
i =   : i ∈ i  ∈ Λa
when α ∈ a   it is a feasible and unique solution 
lemma a    µ∗
i−  and h−i

i is always between i

proof: we can rewrite equation      as follows:

eµ∗

i  µ∗

i −    =

eh−i
i −  

    

i−    then λ∗

i −   should be less than  

where h−i is deﬁned in equation       now  if h−i < i
or equivalently if h−i −   <  
than h−i in order to satisfy       moreover  if λ∗
then λ∗
therefore  h−i < λ∗
i
i−  ≤ λ∗
lemma a    if α ∈ a  =  ei  i−    ∞   there is a unique
ne λ∗ ∈ Λb  with λ∗ =  λ∗

i−  
i should be greater
i > h−i 
i−  in order to satisfy      
i−    then

i ≤ h−i  which proves the lemma 

i−    similarly  if h−i ≥ i

i = i  i −    : i ∈ i 

i < i

proof: first we prove that there is no ne in Λa if α ≥
e i  i e  if α ∈ a  ∪ a    according to theorem a    optimal
price for any operator i can only be λa
i =   if     λ−i  ∈ Λa 
i   since λ∗ =  λ∗
otherwise λc
i =   : i ∈ i   ∈
Λa when α ∈ a  ∪ a   there is no ne in Λa 

i dominates λa

i > i  i −    and λc

secondly  we prove that there is no ne in Λc if α ∈ a  =
 ei  i−    ∞   recall that  when the price vector is in Λc 
h = log αi  > i  i −     which means that there exists
at least one operator with price λc
i ≥
h  remember that if λi ≥ h  then h−i ≤ h  so λi ≥ h−i 
is greater than both h−i and
therefore  for an operator i  λc
i
i  i −     according to theorem a   and lemma a    when
i which
 µ∗
is between h−i and i  i −     this means that for at least one
operator  λc
i   λ−i  ∈
i
Λb  this operator can increase his revenue by reducing his
price to µ∗
i   therefore  there is no ne in λc for the given α
values  and we proved that the ne can only be in Λb 

i   λ−i  ∈ Λb  best response price of operator i is µ∗

i   which implies that  µ∗

is greater than µ∗

finally  we prove that the only ne is λ∗ =  λ∗

i = i  i−   :
i ∈ i   if α ∈ a   according to lemma a    µ∗
i is between
h−i and i  i −    for all operators  h can be greater than or
less than i  i −    if h ≥ i  i −    unless all of the operators
set their prices to i  i −     there exists at least one operator i
with price λi greater than both h−i and i  i −    hence  λi is
i and this operator can increase his revenue
also greater than µ∗
by reducing his price to µ∗
i   similarly  if h < i  i −     there
exists at least one operator with price λi less than both h−i and

i  i −    this operator can increase his revenue by increasing
his price  if all the operators set their prices to λi = i  i −    
the price vector is in Λb and none of the operators can increase
his revenue by unilaterally changing his price  therefore  the
only ne is λ∗ =  λ∗

i = i  i −    : i ∈ i  

hence the lemma is proved 

lemma a     if α ∈ a  =  e i  ei  i−     a ne can only be
in Λc 

proof: in the proof of the lemma a    we showed that
there is no ne in Λa  if α ∈ a   we can also prove that
there is no ne in Λb for the given range of α values  if the
price vector is in Λb and α < ei  i−  
  then h < i  i −    
therefore  there is at least one operator with price λi ≤ h−i
and λi < i  i−    who can increase his revenue by increasing
his price  so we conclude that  if α ∈ a  =  e i  ei  i−    
there is no ne in Λa or Λb 
lemma a     if α ∈ a  =  e i  ei  i−     λ∗ ∈ Λc with
λ∗ =  λ∗

i = log iα  : i ∈ i  is a ne 

i

proof: when all the operators set the same price λ∗

i =
log iα  and α ∈ a  =  e i  ei  i−     log iα  is between
  and µ∗
for all operators  this can be veriﬁed through
i
equation        therefore  for any operator i      λ−i   ∈ Λa
i   λ−i   ∈ Λb  then  according to theorem a    best
and  µ∗
response price is λc
i which is equal to log iα   hence  no
operator can gain more revenue by unilaterally changing his
price  and λ∗ =  λ∗

i = log iα  : i ∈ i  is a ne 

finally we analyze the ne for boundary values of a   i e 
for α = e i and α = ei  i−   i  in the previous lemma  it is
i = log iα  : i ∈ i  is a ne if α ∈ a  
proven that λ∗ =  λ∗
we can also prove that it is the only ne for these boundary
values  in lemma a     it is proven that any ne is in Λc for
these α values  so  when α = e i  h = log iα  =    which
means that unless all of the users set their prices to one  there
exists some operators with λi <    these operators would gain
more revenue by setting their prices to one  hence  the only
ne is λ∗
i = log iα  =    similarly  when α = ei  i−   i 
h = log iα  = i  i −     this means that unless all of the
users set their prices to i  i −     there exists some operators
with λi greater than both h−i and m  m −    these operators
would gain more revenue by reducing their prices  hence  the
only ne is λ∗

i = log iα  = i  i −    

we also show that when α ∈  e i  ei  i−     there can be
inﬁnitely many nes  all in Λc  via numerical simulations  for
different initial price settings  the game converges to different
ne 

theorem a     the game gp attains a pure ne which
depends on the value of parameter α as follows:

• if α ∈ a  =     e i   there is a unique ne λ∗ ∈ Λa 
i ∈ i  and respective market

with λ∗ =  λ∗
equilibrium x∗ ∈ xa 

i =   :

• if α ∈ a  =  e

i

Λb  with λ∗ =  λ∗

i−   i  ∞   there is a unique ne λ∗ ∈
i−  : i ∈ i   which induces a

i = i

respective market equilibrium x∗ ∈ xb 

i

i

• if α ∈ a  =  e i  e

i−   i   there exist inﬁnitely many
nes  λ∗ ∈ Λc  and each one of them yields a respective
market stationary point x∗ ∈ xc 
proof: lemma a   proves that the game gp is a ﬁnite
ordinal potential game  therefore  it always attains a pure ne 
lemma a   proves the case for α ∈ a  =     e i   lemma
i−   i  ∞   the case
a   proves the case for α ∈ a  =  e
for α ∈ a  =  e i  e
