be managed in an optimal and effective manner 
because of the particular features of satellite
networks  such as dynamic topology  non homo 
geneous traffic distribution  limited power and
processing capabilities  and high propagation
delays  new routing approaches should be devel 
oped  in this article  we first examine these prop 
erties with particular emphasis on their effect on
the routing objectives  subsequently  we provide

introduction

with the rapid globalization of the telecommuni 
cations industry  satellites are expected to appear
frequently in future telecommunications systems 
due to their extensive geographic coverage 
inherent broadcast capability  and support for
mission critical applications  communications
over satellites began with the use of individual
satellites rotating on the geostationary orbit
 geo   however  focus has shifted toward the
development of non geostationary  ngeo  sys 
tems consisting of low earth orbit  leo  and
medium earth orbit  meo  satellites because of
the high propagation delays encountered in
geo systems  the high altitude of geo satel 
lites leads to high propagation delays that are
not suitable for most applications  especially for
those running in real time   therefore  for better
utilization of satellites and to increase the per 
formance of the system  new ngeo systems
usually provide on board processing capabilities
including modulation demodulation  encoding 
decoding  transponder beam switching  and rout 
ing  in such systems  any two satellites within
line of sight are connected to each other via
inter satellite links  isl   the use of isl raises
the issue of routing in the satellite network 

employing an efficient routing protocol is a criti 
cal issue  as satellite network resources are costly
and must be managed optimally  the conven 
tional routing techniques proposed for terrestrial
networks are not directly applicable to the next 
generation satellite networks because of certain
features that are particular to satellite systems 
in the next section  we provide a brief back 
ground on these features  in the rest of the arti 
cle  we present a survey of various routing
techniques proposed for satellite networks  sev 
eral technical issues regarding the application of
these techniques are discussed  the final section
provides a conclusion and identifies some future
research directions 

features of satellite networks

a conventional satellite constellation consists of
a number of orbits at a certain altitude  a num 
ber of satellites per orbit  plane   and isl
between some satellite pairs  keeping the orbit
closer to the earth is more attractive  as it allows
for a reduction of the required antenna size as
well as the transmission power level and leads to
shorter communication delay  however  these
advantages come with a price: footprints of
satellites at lower altitudes are smaller  there 
fore  a higher number of satellites are required
for global coverage  in addition  lower orbit
satellites move with higher speeds relative to the
earth’s surface  resulting in a highly dynamic
satellite constellation topology  the mobility of
satellites constitutes a major difference between
satellite networks and their terrestrial counter 
parts  moreover  satellite nodes have different
capabilities than terrestrial nodes  finally  satel 
lite constellation topologies present some specif 
ic geometric properties  in the next section  we
present a brief overview of these properties of
satellite constellation networks  a high perfor 
mance routing algorithm should consider the
effects of all these features 

effects of satellite mobility

satellite network topologies are dynamic — although
the isl between satellites in the same plane
 intra plane isl  are fixed in length  the length
of the isl between satellites from different

the long lead times
between design 
development  
launching  and 
service phases of the
satellite systems 
usually make it 
difficult to implement
state of the art 
technology  
therefore  satellites
should not be
designed specifically
for use only with 
current technology 

planes  inter plane isl  changes depending on
the movement of the satellites  in polar constel 
lations  for example  intra plane isl are the
longest when satellites are over the equator and
the shortest when they are over the polar region
boundaries  moreover  network connectivity can
also vary  isl connectivity between satellites
may change based on the distance and the view 
ing angle between them  isl passing over a
seam also are switched on and off continuously 
on the other hand  when a satellite enters a
polar region  its adjacent inter plane isl are
switched off 

network topology changes are predictable and periodic
— although the topology of a satellite network
rapidly changes  it is deterministic and can be
predicted quite accurately  moreover  the com 
plete topology dynamic is periodic  that is  it
repeats itself within a known period 

traffic is very dynamic and non homogeneous —
because satellites cover smaller areas in low 
orbit systems  traffic requirements are unbal 
anced due to the varying population density 
which is high in cities  low in rural areas  and
almost zero over the oceans  which cover about
   percent of the surface of the earth   as satel 
lites move  traffic received from terrestrial nodes
varies continuously depending on the user densi 
ty in the footprint area 

handovers are required — in connection oriented
satellite network structures  where isl are
switched off due to mobility of the system  a link
handover process is required to maintain active
connections  link handover is required when
isl  connectivity  changes  or  when  the  link
between a user node and a satellite becomes
unavailable 

limitations and capabilities of satellites

power and onboard processing capability are limited —
as more complex processing is carried out in
satellites  they consume more power and their
lifetime becomes shorter  there is a trade off
between the lifetime and the processing capabili 
ty of satellites  actually  a very long lifetime is
not required  because technology improves very
quickly  one drawback of a satellite as compared
to a terrestrial node is that it is infeasible to
upgrade the technology or extend the storage
and processing capabilities of a satellite after it
is launched 

implementing state of the art technology is difficult —
the long lead times between design  develop 
ment  launching  and service phases of the satel 
lite  systems  usually  make  it  difficult  to
implement state of the art technology  there 
fore  satellites should not be designed specifical 
ly for use only with current technology  and
interfaces with terrestrial networks also should
be designed with a similar approach 

satellites have a broadcast nature — satellites offer
great potential for multimedia applications
because of their capability to broadcast and mul 
ticast large amounts of data over a very large
area 

features due to the nature of

satellite constellations

higher propagation delays — because of the long
distances between satellites and the high altitude
of the constellation  propagation delay is consid 
ered the most important cost factor in satellite
networks  as the altitude of the orbit increases 
the effect of propagation delay becomes more
evident 

fixed number of nodes — disregarding satellite
failures  usually the number of nodes in a satel 
lite network is fixed unlike most terrestrial net 
works  where new links or destinations can be
added on a daily basis 

highly symmetric and uniform structure — since the
constellation topology is highly symmetric and
uniform  there can be many alternate paths
between two satellite nodes  selection of the
most appropriate path can effectively increase
the utilization of the system 

taking these features into consideration  vari 
ous routing techniques are proposed for satellite
networks  the main objectives behind these pro 
posals can be classified as follows:

   to handle dynamic topology changes with
minimum overhead: for this purpose  mainly the
periodicity and predictability of the constellation
topology are considered  frequent handovers
and limited storage and processing capabilities
of satellites are challenges 

   to prevent the dropping of an outgoing
call due to link handover as the satellite topolo 
gy changes: for this purpose  some of the pro 
posed routing algorithms aim at reducing the
probability of link handover occurrence  mainly
periodicity and predictability of topology changes
are considered 

   to minimize the length of the paths in
terms of propagation delay and or number of
satellite hops to avoid poor resource utilization
as well as high end to end delay: constant size
and highly symmetric and uniform nature of the
constellations constructs are advantageous fea 
tures that should be considered 

   to prevent congestion of some isl while
others are idle: for this purpose  various load
balancing algorithms are proposed  as a com 
mon feature  these algorithms are adaptive to
dynamic and non homogeneous traffic  load
balancing algorithms could also benefit from
symmetric and uniform characteristics of con 
stellation topologies and must consider physical
restrictions of satellites 

   to perform traffic based routing to satisfy
quality of service  qos  requirements: in this
context  the main problems are dynamic topolo 
gy and traffic  frequent handovers  and physical
limitations of satellites 

   to provide better integration of satellite
networks with terrestrial networks: in this con 
text  some works try to apply existing routing
algorithms to satellite constellations to provide
easier integration of the satellite network to the
terrestrial network  as an example  some works
examine how to adapt ip routing to satellites  so
that the constellation can be seamlessly integrat 
ed with the internet  on the other hand  if the

to achieve each of these seven objectives 
some of the aforementioned features of satellite
systems should be considered  table   shows the
relationship between classes of routing objectives
and satellite features  the check marks indicate
the existence of an effective relation but are not
necessarily restricted to those shown in table   

routing in satellite networks

in this section  we examine how the proposed
routing techniques may achieve the objectives
stated in the previous section and discuss some
of their advantages and disadvantages 

routing issues in a dynamic topology

due to the rapid changes in the status of the
links and satellite positions  a satellite network
can be considered as a dynamic topology net 
work  the utilization of conventional routing
techniques widely used in terrestrial networks is
not feasible for satellite networks  because
these protocols rely on the exchange of topolo 
gy  information  that  must  be  constantly
refreshed  which incurs substantial overhead 
however  although the topology of a satellite
network rapidly changes  these changes are
periodic and predictable because of the strict
orbital movements of the satellites  therefore 
some routing techniques are proposed utilizing
this periodicity feature  in      a leo satellite
network is modeled as a finite state automaton 
where the system period  which is the least
common multiple of the orbital period of the
satellite layer and the earth period  is divided
into states  the states are derived from the isl

connectivity data  so that the network has a
fixed topology in each state  due to the period 
icity of the constellation topology  there can be
only a finite number of states  then  it is pro 
posed to perform optimal routing on each of
these fixed topologies for the best use of isl in
the system  a number of routing tables are
stored on board and retrieved when topology
changes  although the messaging overhead and
computational complexity is reduced  large
storage capacity is required in the satellites  to
reduce the on board storage requirements  a
suitable number of network control centers
 ncc   usually located on the ground  can be
used  in this context  deciding on the number of
ncc to use and their distribution on the globe
are left as open issues 

another concept worth mentioning that is
tailored to dynamic satellite constellation is the
virtual node  vn  concept  in the vn tech 
nique  a fixed virtual topology consisting of vn
is superimposed over the physical topology to
hide the mobility of satellites from the routing
protocols  routing is performed in the fixed
virtual topology by the use of a common rout 
ing protocol  this scheme can directly integrate
the space network with the terrestrial ip net 
work and may provide good support for ip 
multicast  and  ip qos        however   this
approach presents some challenging problems
such as scalability of routing tables and high
computational complexity in space devices 
moreover      states that one to one mapping
of physical topology to a virtual topology is
problematic for several reasons  one reason is
the sun outage phenomenon  where the satellite
serving a fixed footprint is in the same line of
sight with the sun  this incurs inefficiency due
to highly non uniform user density and the pos 
sibility of better coverage in a region of a non 
serving satellite  therefore  further work is
required to improve the vn concept

when compared to
terrestrial networks 
the propagation
delay is more 
important in space
networks due to the
altitude of the 
satellites orbit and
long distances
between the nodes 
moreover  as a
greater number of
satellite hops is 
traversed  total 
processing and 
propagation delays
increase 

reducing link handovers and

rerouting issues

when  a  connection  is  broken   the  issue  of
 re connection setup overhead is imperative for
satellite networks due to the highly dynamic
nature of the network topology  when some isl
are switched off or the up down link  udl 
between the terrestrial node and the correspond 
ing  initial  satellite  is  broken   handover  is
required to maintain the active connections 
rerouting attempts during link handovers cause
delay jitter and signaling overhead  moreover 
because of the possibility of resource unavailabil 
ity in alternate paths and the delay caused by
rerouting  the forced termination probability of
ongoing connections is increased  therefore  it is
desirable to minimize the possibility of rerouting
due to handovers  it is especially important for
real time multimedia applications to maintain
qos guarantees using a connection oriented
routing protocol  thus  minimizing the number
of connection handovers is a crucial issue 

to reduce link handovers  jukan et al  pro 
pose to reduce the handover ratio by favoring
isl with higher lifetimes      for each connec 
tion request  request packets are flooded towards
the destination  while traversing the route  these
packets gather the lifetime information of inter 
mediate satellites  and this information is used
by the destination node for deciding on the most
appropriate path  chen et al      also consider
minimizing handovers in their proposed adaptive
routing scheme  among the set of paths that sat 
isfy the qos requirements  a path that can mini 
mize the possible number of handovers and that
also is not inferior to the best possible path with
a predefined degree is selected 

the above mentioned procedures create opti 
mization between two satellite nodes  hence 
only isl handovers are considered  however  a
connection also should be re established when
the udl between the source ground station and
the ingress satellite — or between the destina 
tion ground station and the egress satellite — is
broken  this kind of handover is defined as
inter satellite handover     and should be consid 
ered for better optimization  it is preferable to
reduce inter satellite handovers due to the
movement of satellites with respect to user sta 
tions  in      uzunalioglu  et al  introduce a
probabilistic routing protocol  prp  that tries to
reduce rerouting between two ground end users
by utilizing leo satellite topology dynamics and
call statistics  basically  the algorithm tries not
to use isl that would be switched off before the
connection is over  since exact call duration is
not known a priori  the probability density func 
tion  pdf  of the time duration in which the
call uses the established route is utilized  the
determined pdf is used to establish the routes
of the connection  such that the routes are ter 
minated by a call termination event or an inter 
satellite handover instead of a link handover
with a target probability p  a distinction is made
between route calculation for newly arrived calls
and inter satellite handover calls because drop 
ping an ongoing call that experiences an inter 
satellite  handover  is  more  annoying  than
blocking a new call 

path minimization algorithms

in a satellite network  the cost of a path is deter 
mined by the propagation and processing delays
on the satellites  when compared to terrestrial
networks  the propagation delay is more impor 
tant in space networks due to the altitude of the
satellites orbit and long distances between the
nodes  moreover  as a greater number of satel 
lite hops is traversed  total processing and prop 
agation delays increase  reducing the processing
delay has beneficial side effects  such as reducing
the data blocking probability and yielding better
power consumption in satellites  therefore  path
minimization is a crucial task in satellite net 
works 

in some works  it is assumed that isl have
fixed lengths  various authors argue that this
assumption is reasonable because in most of the
constellation topologies  the length variation is
low  especially for crowded regions that are clos 
er to the equatorial region  moreover  it also is
claimed that minimizing the hop count is more
critical for improving the performance of the
system  and therefore it is reasonable to ignore
dynamic length variations of isl  on the other
hand  numerous authors think that the dominat 
ing factor for performance is the propagation
delay  and they aim to find a minimum propaga 
tion delay path with the minimal hop count
among the paths  this complicates the task 
because isl lengths change with time due to the
dynamism of the topology  the predictability of
topology changes  and the known facts about the
nature of satellite networks  e g   links over the
polar regions are shorter than links over the
equatorial region  can be used to simplify this
task  nevertheless  extra storage and processing
complexity is required to consider the propaga 
tion delays 

sun et al      deal with static routing in a reg 
ular leo satellite network that is modeled as a
two dimensional n ary hypercube  the mini 
mum hop path is found by the dijkstra algo 
rithm  and contention resolution schemes are
investigated for maximizing the throughput  it is
shown analytically and validated by simulation
results that a scheduling scheme favoring pack 
ets closest to their destinations results in maxi 
mum system throughput  at the expense of
degraded system fairness  actually  there could
be many minimum hop paths in a satellite con 
stellation  due to its symmetric and uniform
nature  therefore  it is proposed in some works
to favor the one with the minimum propagation
delay  the most trivial way to do this is to store
the length information of all links for a system
period in each satellite  or in ground stations
that perform routing  and to apply a shortest 
path algorithm using this information  this
requires a high storage capacity  henderson et
al      and ekici et al      develop distributed
algorithms for minimizing the propagation delay 
the geography based algorithm of henderson et
al  is based on the hypothesis that the series of
locally optimal forwarding decisions will yield a
route that is close to the optimal route  in other
words  depending on the geographic information
embedded in the addresses  each satellite for 
wards the packet to its neighbor that most

reduces the distance to the destination  on the
other hand  ekici et al      introduce the data 
gram routing algorithm  dra  for an idealized
polar constellation  it regards the satellite net 
work as a mesh topology consisting of logical
locations  virtual nodes   data packets are rout 
ed in a distributed fashion in this fixed topology 
dra consists of two phases: at a given satellite
hop  it first finds all the neighboring satellites
that can move the packet one hop closer to the
destination  then  from the candidate next hops 
it selects the one that most reduces the remain 
ing distance to the destination 

there are many other algorithms that utilize
information on expected traffic characteristics
and handover possibilities of isl while applying
a shortest path algorithm or similarly consider
dynamic traffic characteristics while deciding on
the most appropriate path among a set of short 
est paths  the objective of those algorithms from
the latter group is mainly to distribute the traffic
load in a more balanced way  they are described
in the following section 

load balancing algorithms

because population distribution on the surface
of  the  earth  is  highly  non uniform   traffic
requirements are unbalanced in a low orbit
satellite network  this may lead to congestion in
some resources  while others are under utilized 
to overcome this problem  the routing algorithm
should distribute the flows in a balanced way

over appropriate isl between the communicat 
ing nodes 

we classify these algorithms according to the
place where the routing is performed: source 
based  central  distributed  and hierarchical load 
balancing algorithms  as shown in table   

source based load balancing — in source based
load balancing algorithms  the route to a given
destination node is calculated by the ingress
node  the ingress node could be a terrestrial
node or a satellite  if it is located on the ground 
an extra signaling delay is introduced  however 
in the latter case  computational and storage
requirements to perform route calculation can
exceed the capacity limits of a satellite 

franck et al      further classify source based
load balancing algorithms as isolated and non 
isolated algorithms  isolated algorithms use only
information local to the node where routing is
performed  in non isolated algorithms  traffic
information is gathered from the whole network 
authors suggest a non isolated algorithm as fol 
lows: each node keeps the graph of the whole
network  when routing is performed  all nodes
and edges that are near to saturation point are
pruned  then a shortest path algorithm is run 
considering the propagation delay as well as the
constant transit delay per hop 

chen and jamalipour in     propose an alter 
native adaptive routing algorithm that uses the
information on both the average and the mini 

ieee wireless communications • june

because of the 
highly symmetric
and uniform 
structure of satellite
constellations  there
can be many 
minimum hop paths
between two 
satellites  and 
routing probably can
be done efficiently 

mum number of occupied channels per route 
first  the algorithm finds a set of candidate min 
imum delay paths that also minimize the han 
dover probability and delay jitter  then  among
these alternate paths  the one with minimum
traffic weight  which is determined by a weighted
combination of average and minimum number
of occupied channels over the route  is selected 
non isolated routing technique increases the
computational and signaling complexity of the
routing architecture  but it is superior to isolated
algorithms because it considers traffic adaptivity
in the whole network  however  there is a poten 
tial drawback of non isolated algorithms: the
gathered traffic information may not reflect the
actual condition since the information takes time
to be distributed in the constellation  due to
high propagation delays  and to avoid excessive
signaling  state changes in the network are not
always advertised 

central load balancing — in central load balancing
algorithms  routing tables are calculated in a
central node and then stored in the satellite
nodes  this central node can be a satellite or a
terrestrial node  mainly  we can consider opti 
mal routing algorithms in this context  optimal 
routing algorithms are network oriented  aimed
at minimizing the mean blocking probability in
the network by providing better load balancing 

the aforementioned finite state automaton
 fsa  based algorithm of chang et al       which
is offline  assigns expected traffic loads to links
depending on the statistical information on the
potential requirement density for each node and
the distance between the nodes  for each state 
it aims to maximize the minimum residual capac 
ity in the network  because this is an np com 
plete mixed integer optimization problem  it
uses heuristics to provide optimal routing 
authors conclude through simulation that opti 
mal routing is superior in terms of newly initiat 
ed and ongoing call blocking probability 

papapetreu et al       propose to perform the
flow deviation  fd  algorithm  which is a well
known optimal routing algorithm that aims to
find a routing pattern that minimizes the mean
network delay  depending on the information
gathered from the whole network  a designated
central node performs the fd algorithm  the
fd algorithm splits the load among different
paths according to path lengths that are defined
as a flow dependent metric  as the lengths of
the paths change  the fd algorithm continuously
adapts these changes by deviating traffic from
one path to another  so that the defined cost
metric is minimized  the authors show by simu 
lation that the fd algorithm is superior to the
dijkstra algorithm for finding the path minimiz 
ing the propagation delay and to the adaptive
dijkstra algorithm for finding the path minimiz 
ing a flow metric 

by performing routing at a central node  bet 
ter traffic engineering could be maintained using
the global view of the network  however  central
load balancing algorithms share the same prob 
lems with non isolated source based routing
algorithms  computational complexity can be
carried to a ground node that does not suffer
much from power limits  but the high signaling

requirement and the difficulty of accurately
transferring traffic information are the most
challenging problems  moreover  the centralized
routing approach may present scalability prob 
lems due to the capacity limits of the central
node and the rapid increase in the computation 
al complexity with the enlargement of the net 
work size 

distributed load balancing — because of the highly
symmetric and uniform structure of satellite con 
stellations  there can be many minimum hop
paths between two satellites  and routing proba 
bly can be done efficiently  establishing a static
connection between two nodes may lead to poor
utilization of alternate paths  moreover  as we
mentioned before  the connection oriented
approach may suffer in attaining path connectivi 
ty by handover mechanisms  rather  a distribut 
ed next hop routing strategy seems to be simpler 
each satellite independently decides on the best
next hop to forward the packet  ekici et al     
implement this approach in the aforementioned
dra  the main objective of the algorithm is to
minimize the propagation delay  but a satellite
may change its decision if the output queue for
the isl over the minimum propagation delay
path is congested  taleb et al       claim that a
better load balancing might be achieved  given
that a satellite is aware of the traffic conditions
at the next hop satellite  they propose an explic 
it load balancing  elb  scheme  where a con 
gested satellite sends a signal to its neighboring
satellites to decrease their sending rates  and its
neighbors  search  for  alternate  paths   this
method reduces the packet dropping probability 
but it is not safe from signaling congestion due
to feedback packets  even though signaling pack 
ets are sent only when it is necessary  they could
be required very frequently in some conditions  
algorithms in     and      do not take any action
for load balancing until some nodes experience a
certain level of congestion  that is  they are not
proactive  in       we show that it is more appro 
priate to avoid congestion before it happens and
provide a priority based adaptive routing  par 
algorithm that aims to balance the traffic before
congestion occurs  we compare par with other
adaptive minimum hop path algorithms  such as
fixed adaptive routing  far  and random adap 
tive routing  rar   at each hop  among the isl
that are on a minimum hop path  far first
selects the one that is toward a given direction
 vertical or horizontal   if that link is congested 
the other direction is selected  rar makes the
selection of the initial isl candidate in a ran 
dom manner  simulation results show that using
the  par  algorithm  not  only  increases  the
throughput  but also decreases the queuing
delay  moreover  the par algorithm does not
incur any signaling overhead due to feedback
packets 

the distributed load balancing algorithms
mentioned previously provide fast reaction to
traffic changes when compared with the source 
based and centralized load balancing algorithms 
however  they use only the local traffic informa 
tion  which might not reflect the entire traffic
load distribution  surely  it is possible to dis 
tribute the local information to the whole net

work and use it in local next hop decisions  but
this will cause extensive signaling overhead

hierarchical load balancing — hierarchical  multi 
layered  satellite architectures with inter orbital
links  iol  between layers of satellite constella 
tions are of much interest  as they may yield bet 
ter performance than individual layers  figure

applications  the hierarchical approach aims to
reduce the computational complexity on the
satellites and the communication load on the

ture is composed of leo and meo layers  the
lower layer  leo  satellites send isl state mes 
sages to the upper layer  the upper layer  meo 
satellite uses this state information to derive
some local routing information  lri  about the
leo satellites that are in its coverage area
 these change with time due to the relative
mobility of leo satellites with respect to meo
satellites   this information also is exchanged
between meo satellites  in addition  meo
satellites derive global routing information
 gri   including all routing information of the
leo and meo layer satellites  by using this
exchanged state information and send it through
iol to all leo layer satellites that are within
their coverage area  in the proposed routing
algorithm  short distance dependent traffic is
transmitted through lower layer satellites  but
long distance dependent traffic is transmitted
through iol up to the meo layer to minimize
the  average  number  of  satellite  hops  and
resource consumption 

the satellite grouping and routing protocol
 sgrp  proposed in      is another hierarchical
algorithm where leo satellites are divided into
groups according to the footprint area of the
meo satellites in each snapshot period  each
leo group is managed by a meo  similar to
the proposal in       a meo satellite computes
the minimum delay paths for its leo members 
depending on the link state information arriving
from the leo satellites  the authors provide a
detailed analysis of their proposed system 

dash et al       consider a three layered archi 
tecture consisting of geo  leo  and high alti 
tude platforms  hap  for voice over ip  voip 
applications  geo act as the backbone routers 
leo as the second layer  and hap cover special
areas with high and sensitive traffic  such as bat 
tlefields and disaster areas  the leo layer satel 
lites are assumed to have earth fixed footprints 
and they are modelled as virtual nodes; hence
the geo satellites cover logically fixed leo
topologies  the leo satellites exchange their
routing tables as their footprint area changes 
this architecture enables all the satellites to see
other layers as stationary  the leo satellites
and hap measure residual bandwidth on their
outgoing links and send the information to the
geo layer within a given period  since the geo
satellites have limited on board processing
capacities  this link state information can be sent
to the fixed terrestrial gateways for processing

after forming intra domain routing tables  the
gateways upload these tables to the geo layer 
and the geo satellites flood them to the leo
satellites and hap that are in their coverage
area  an aggregated routing table for each
domain is also formed that includes the maxi 
mum residual bandwidth paths between differ 
ent border nodes of the domain  then  these
tables are exchanged between geos and trans 
ferred to the lower layers 

the advent of hierarchical architectures
implies more redundancy and routing choices in
satellite systems  a variety of topological design
and routing issues should be investigated to
enable the best use of satellite technologies in
future communication systems 

traffic based routing

to support the rapidly growing real time multi 
media services  satellite systems should offer
qos guarantees  which is particularly difficult in
connectionless networks due to the difficulty in
accounting for the delay aspects of qos and
sequencing  usually  qos guarantees are provid 
ed through connection orientation  however 
due to the high mobility of satellites in non geo 
stationary systems  it is difficult to attain path
connectivity  therefore  some of the algorithms
described previously aim at minimizing the
rerouting probability due to handovers while cal 
culating the routes  nevertheless  it is not easy to
offer qos guarantees without reducing the
rerouting probability to very low levels  the vn

there is a significant
time gap between
the design and the
operational stages of
a satellite system 
that lag usually
makes it difficult to
provide and to utilize
state of the art 
technology in orbit 

concept can be used to remove topology changes 
however  this approach also has its drawbacks as
described previously  therefore  this topic
requires further study 

another issue in providing qos guarantees is
to reduce delay variation  jitter  that occurs due
to path rerouting  in a leo satellite network 
the movement of satellites causes changes in rel 
ative positions between any two satellites that
belong to different orbits  this may result in
unacceptable levels of delay jitter  therefore  a
routing algorithm must try to reduce the delay
jitter for better qos conditions while at the
same time keeping the delay itself as low as pos 
sible  this issue is considered in the context of
various proposed algorithms in the literature     
regarding handovers  a routing algorithm is
expected to choose a new path that is not much
different from the previous one in its length 
although sometimes the selected path is not the
best  shortest  one 

jukan et al      propose a distributed qos 
routing approach  the source node floods con 
nection request packets towards the destination 
at each intermediate node  the quality parame 
ters  delay  lifetime of isl  etc   are updated 
when connection request packets reach the des 
tination node  the destination eliminates the
paths that do not satisfy the qos requirements 
among all feasible paths  the one with the mini 
mum number of hops and maximum lifetime is
selected 

kandus et al       propose a traffic class 
dependent  tcd  routing algorithm  three
classes of traffic are considered:     delay sensi 
tive traffic      throughput sensitive traffic  and
    best effort traffic  the routing algorithm
behaves differently for each class of traffic  each
satellite has three separate outgoing queues  one
for each traffic class   serving for each outgoing
link  a scheduler should be implemented that
defines the actual transmission sequence of
packets in outgoing queues  obviously  the selec 
tion of the scheduling policy has a large impact
on the routing performance of the particular
traffic class  therefore  the authors investigate
five different scheduling policies that we do not
describe in this article  the tcd algorithm
attempts to guarantee qos for different traffic
classes  however  it may assign a single route for
a specific class with high data traffic and may
heavily overload the chosen path  this may neg 
atively affect the traffic load balancing over the
entire constellation 

routing from a space ground

integration point of view

the problem of how to integrate space networks
with terrestrial networks arises when considering
using satellite systems as a part of a global com 
munication system  such as the internet   basi 
cally   there  are  two  trends  in  this  context:
according to the first trend  the goal is to apply
the existing algorithms as extensively as possible
and provide interfaces with terrestrial networks
as easily as possible  conversely  there is a sec 
ond trend to use an arbitrary routing protocol in
the space segment  in other words  the satellite
network can be designed and operated indepen 

  

ieee wireless communications • june     

wood et al      claim that in the future  satel 

dently of the terrestrial network  the disadvan 
tage of the latter trend is that an address resolu 
tion  protocol  and  complex  interworking
functions are required  however  it is a better
approach than the former trend in terms of scal 
ability 

currently  the internet protocol  ip  domi 
nates the end systems attached to the satellite
terminals  therefore  research that investigates
how to apply ip routing directly to satellite sys 
tems can be considered in the context of the first
trend  wood et al      examine a strategy  based
on the vn concept  that aims to adopt ip rout 
ing at the satellites  this strategy permits direct
support for ip multicast and ip qos  integrated
and differentiated service models   however 
there are challenging problems with this tech 
nique  first  the variable length ip packets must
fit into a fixed length frame structure in the
space segment  the authors propose to achieve
this by using either explicit ip level fragmenta 
tion or implicit lower level fragmentation to
break packets  such that they can fill in the
frames  and by using padding to fill up the frame
structures  the second important problem is
scalability  when the terrestrial network increas 
es in size  a large amount of routing information
must be updated for both the terrestrial and the
satellite networks  however  this is not feasible
for satellites  because the capacity of satellites is
limited and cannot be upgraded after they are
launched  therefore  it is better to separate and
isolate satellite and internet routing updates 
finally  because ip routing is slow and requires
high processing power  it is not suitable for satel 
lites that are equipped with limited on board
processing capacities  the authors argue that the
ip routing performance is continuously improv 
ing and that by using some shortcut ip switching
techniques  such as multi protocol label switch 
ing  mpls   it seems possible to overcome this
problem  we briefly discuss mpls over satellite
constellations in the last part of this section 

there is a significant time gap between the
design and the operational stages of a satellite
system  that lag usually makes it difficult to pro 
vide and to utilize state of the art technology in
orbit  moreover  next generation satellite net 
works are expected to provide and support mul 
tiple types of services and to interwork with
different terrestrial networks  such as broadband
integrated services digital network  b isdn  
internet  and so on  therefore  it is reasonable
to isolate the routing in the space segment from
that in the terrestrial networks  for this purpose 
it is suggested to view the satellite network as an
autonomous  system   as   with  a  different
addressing scheme 

in terrestrial networks  the cost metrics
between different as are the dominating factor
when establishing a route between nodes from
different as  generally  this is because the inter 
nal paths in a terrestrial as are much shorter
than the inter as paths  however  this is not the
case for a satellite network  because an internal
path easily can be as long as an external path 
thus  in the satellite context  the routing proto 
col should consider the internal cost metric to be
as important as the external one

lite constellations can carry ip traffic by using a
combination of border routing protocols  tunnel 
ing  network address translation  and mpls 
mpls enables the adopting of new paradigms
for conventional ip traffic by decoupling packet
forwarding from the information carried in the
ip header  this is achieved by distributing the
routing information to the core routers and
assigning short labels to the packets at the
ingress point  mpls has appealing mechanisms
that essentially support the integration of the ip
world with qos and traffic engineering features 
donner et al       deal with how to adopt mpls
over a satellite constellation  constellation
topologies that do not have a seam  inclined
walker constellations  are seen as the strongest
candidates to host mpls  due to their perma 
nent nature  nevertheless  the inherent and fre 
quent handovers between ground and satellite
stations and topology dynamics due to varying
isl lengths remain a challenge  at the ingress
point of an mpls network  there are label edge
routers  ler  that manage the label distribution
and in some cases  perform route computations 
the authors propose to locate ler on the
ground to avoid
• expensive and complex on board processing in

the satellites

• extra signaling overhead required for restart 
ing qos negotiation or admission control for
rerouting of a label switching path  lsp 

different  scenarios  for  route  computation
 including “intelligence” in terms of traffic engi 
neering  adaptiveness  and or optimization  and
lsp management  establishing the result of
route computation in the network  are investigat 
ed  centralized routing approaches are viewed
as more promising for use within an mpls
framework  for further information  see      
mpls based networking in satellite constella 
tions is an appealing approach  however  some
important practical problems related to rerout 
ing and maintenance overhead are still unsolved
and deserve further study 

multicast routing

given the ability of satellites to broadcast large
amounts of data over a very wide area  multicas 
ting  over  satellites  has  become  a  very  hot
research topic  ekici et al       indicate that none
of the existing multicast routing protocols  such
as reverse path multicast  rvm   distance vec 
tor multicast routing protocol  dvmrp   or
multicast routing extensions for open shortest
path first  ospf   such as multicast ospf
 mospf   are suitable for satellite networks 
because they employ some type of periodic mes 
sage exchanges to form or maintain multicast
trees  and this is not favorable due to the physi 
cal limitations of satellites  to fill the gap 
authors developed a multicast routing protocol
for leo satellite ip networks  where multicast
trees are formed based on dra      the algo 
rithm aims to minimize the number of branches
extending from a satellite at each step  authors
conclude that their algorithm outperforms exist 
ing multicast routing algorithms in terms of end 
to end delay  but  multicast routing algorithms
for multi layered satellite networks still is an
appealing research area 

conclusions

satellite communication systems have some
intrinsic features that significantly affect the per 
formance of their routing algorithms  in particu 
lar  adopting traffic and topology dynamics may
incur significant overhead in the course of utiliz 
ing satellite resources  various routing algo 
rithms were proposed for satellite networks to
overcome this drawback  in this article  we clas 
sified these algorithms and described relevant
technical issues for use in the next generation
satellite networks  although some algorithms
seem to meet performance criteria in certain
cases  routing algorithms that support minimum
overhead with better resource utilization remain
a practical problem for the next generation satel 
lite communication networks  both qos and
multicast routing algorithms are still formidable
tasks in satellite networks  furthermore  the
advent of sophisticated satellite network archi 
tectures  such as multi layered systems and new
space technologies such as hap  continue to
broaden potential routing choices
